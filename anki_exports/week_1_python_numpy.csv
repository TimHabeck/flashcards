"What is the shape rule for Matrix-Matrix multiplication \((n, d) \times (d, f)\)?","The result is a matrix of shape <strong>\((n, f)\)</strong>. The number of columns in the left matrix must match the number of rows in the right matrix.","week-1 python numpy matrix-multiplication source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"How can the inner product \(u \cdot v\) of two column-shaped vectors be written in matrix-vector multiplication notation?","<blockquote>\(u \cdot v = u^T v\)</blockquote> (The transpose \(u^T\) converts the column vector to a row vector).","week-1 python numpy inner-product source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"In Python, what is the difference between ""mutable"" and ""immutable"" objects regarding their content?","<ul><li><strong>Mutable</strong> (e.g., <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>set</code>): Content can be changed after creation.</li><li><strong>Immutable</strong> (e.g., <code>str</code>, <code>tuple</code>, <code>int</code>): Content cannot be changed. Concatenation (<code>+=</code>) overwrites the whole object with a new copy.</li></ul>","week-1 python mutability source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"[GOTCHA] How does ""Call by Object Reference"" behave when passing a whole object (e.g., a list) to a function and reassigning it?","You <strong>cannot</strong> change the object outside the function by reassigning it as a whole (the change only affects the internal copy). <blockquote><code>def f(x): x = [1, 2, 3] # Outside x is unchanged</code></blockquote>","week-1 python call-by-object-reference source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"[GOTCHA] How does ""Call by Object Reference"" behave when modifying <strong>mutable members</strong> of an object (e.g., appending to a list)?","Modifying a <strong>mutable member</strong> (e.g., <code>list.append()</code>, <code>dict[key] = val</code>) <strong>does</strong> reflect outside the function call.","week-1 python call-by-object-reference source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"How can you make a change to an immutable object (like a string) visible outside a function call?","By using the <strong><code>return</code></strong> statement to return the modified copy and reassigning it outside.","week-1 python immutability source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"What is the purpose of the <code>typing</code> module in Python (e.g., for use with <code>mypy</code>)?","It allows for <strong>static type hints</strong> in function signatures, specifying expected input and output types for better code quality and error detection.","week-1 python typing source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"What is the primary difference between the <code>str</code> type and the <code>bytes</code> type in Python 3?","<ul><li><strong>str</strong>: Sequence of Unicode characters; handles international text.</li><li><strong>bytes</strong>: Sequence of 1-byte elements (raw data, range 0-255); often used for network packets or files.</li></ul>","week-1 python strings bytes source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"How do you convert between <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code>?","<ul><li><code>str.encode('utf-8')</code> \(\to\) <code>bytes</code></li><li><code>bytes.decode('utf-8')</code> \(\to\) <code>str</code></li></ul>","week-1 python strings bytes source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"Why is the <code>with</code> statement (context manager) used when opening files?","It ensures the file handle is <strong>automatically closed</strong> via the <code>__exit__</code> method, even if an error occurs.","week-1 python files source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"When should you use the <code>pickle</code> module vs. <code>readline()</code>?","Use <strong><code>pickle</code></strong> for saving/loading complex Python objects (lists, dictionaries) directly; use <code>readline()</code> for plain text files.","week-1 python files pickle source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"[CAUTION] What is a major security risk associated with Python's <code>pickle</code> module?","Loading a **malicious pickle file** can lead to arbitrary code execution; never unpickle data from untrusted sources.","week-1 python files pickle security source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"Why is it critical to <strong>seed</strong> random number generators (RNGs) in machine learning experiments?","To ensure <strong>reproducibility</strong> of results and scientific experiments.","week-1 python numpy rng source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"In NumPy, what is the difference between <code>np.matmul(a, b)</code> and <code>a * b</code>?","<ul><li><code>np.matmul(a, b)</code>: Matrix multiplication.</li><li><code>a * b</code>: Element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product).</li></ul>","week-1 python numpy source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"What is <code>np.einsum</code> used for?","It is a powerful tool for performing **general linear algebra** (summation and multiplication) across tensors by Einstein summation notation.","week-1 python numpy einsum source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"How does negative indexing work in NumPy slicing (e.g., <code>a[2:-5]</code>)?","Negative indices count from the <strong>end</strong> of the array. <code>a[2:-5]</code> starts at index 2 and stops 5 elements before the end (dropping the last 5).","week-1 python numpy slicing source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"How do you reverse a NumPy array <code>a</code> using slicing?","<blockquote><code>a[::-1]</code></blockquote> (Step of -1 reverses the order).","week-1 python numpy slicing source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"Which NumPy function is used to solve a linear system \(Ax = b\)?","<blockquote><code>np.linalg.solve(A, b)</code></blockquote>","week-1 python numpy linalg source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
"In Matplotlib, what is the difference between a <strong>Figure</strong> and an <strong>Axes</strong> (Subplot)?","A <strong>Figure</strong> is the top-level container/window; an <strong>Axes</strong> is an individual plot or sub-plot within that figure.","week-1 python matplotlib source::week-1-slides-l2-python"
