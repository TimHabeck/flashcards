"20260121-1730-01-9","How do you convert between <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code>?","<ul><li><code>str.encode('utf-8')</code> \(\to\) <code>bytes</code></li><li><code>bytes.decode('utf-8')</code> \(\to\) <code>str</code></li></ul>","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python strings bytes"
"20260121-1730-01-10","Why is the <code>with</code> statement (context manager) used when opening files?","It ensures the file handle is <strong>automatically closed</strong> via the <code>__exit__</code> method, even if an error occurs.","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python files"
"20260121-1730-01-11","When should you use the <code>pickle</code> module vs. <code>readline()</code>?","Use <strong><code>pickle</code></strong> for saving/loading complex Python objects (lists, dictionaries) directly; use <code>readline()</code> for plain text files.","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python files pickle"
"20260121-1730-01-12","[CAUTION] What is a major security risk associated with Python's <code>pickle</code> module?","Loading a **malicious pickle file** can lead to arbitrary code execution; never unpickle data from untrusted sources.","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python files pickle security"
"20260121-1730-01-13","Why is it critical to <strong>seed</strong> random number generators (RNGs) in machine learning experiments?","To ensure <strong>reproducibility</strong> of results and scientific experiments.","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python numpy rng"
"20260121-1730-01-14","In NumPy, what is the difference between <code>np.matmul(a, b)</code> and <code>a * b</code>?","<ul><li><code>np.matmul(a, b)</code>: Matrix multiplication.</li><li><code>a * b</code>: Element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product).</li></ul>","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python numpy"

"20260121-1730-01-16","How does negative indexing work in NumPy slicing (e.g., <code>a[2:-5]</code>)?","Negative indices count from the <strong>end</strong> of the array. <code>a[2:-5]</code> starts at index 2 and stops 5 elements before the end (dropping the last 5).","week 1 - slides_l2_python.txt","week-1 python numpy slicing"
