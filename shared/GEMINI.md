# Directory Overview

This directory contains course materials for a university-level course, likely focused on Deep Learning or Machine Learning. The materials are organized by week and include lecture slides in both PDF and plain text formats, homework assignments, and supplementary Python code.

The content spans approximately 15 weeks of a semester.

# Key Files and Directories

*   **`setup/`**: Contains the core configuration and instruction files for the flashcard generation process, including the style guide, master database, and session templates.

*   **`textfiles_for_searching/`**: This directory is a crucial resource. It contains the text-only versions of all the lecture slides. This is the ideal place to search for specific keywords, topics, or concepts covered in the course.

*   **`week <N> - slides_...`**: The root directory contains the original PDF lecture slides for each week.

*   **`week <N> - homework/`**: These directories contain the homework assignments for each corresponding week. They may include PDFs, text files, and sometimes starter code or data.

*   **`*.py` files**: There are a few Python script files, such as `fmnist_pytorch_logreg_class.py`. These appear to be standalone examples or templates related to the course content, focusing on frameworks like PyTorch.

# Usage

This directory serves as a personal archive of course materials. To find information on a specific topic, it is highly recommended to use the search functionality within the `textfiles_for_searching/` directory. The original PDFs can be consulted for better visual formatting of the lecture content. The homework folders contain the assignments and related materials.
