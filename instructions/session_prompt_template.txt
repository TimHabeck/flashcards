Start a new flashcard generation session.

Your first step is to read and fully understand the project's established procedures:
1. `instructions/instructions.md`
2. `instructions/flashcard_style_guide.md`

After reading the shared procedures, locate the course folder based on the slide file path provided below and load:
3. `[COURSE_FOLDER]/course_info.txt`
4. `[COURSE_FOLDER]/flashcards_master.csv`

Finally, begin processing the following source file:
{{SLIDE_PATH}}

P.S. I have this weird document which is a summary made from memory about what the prof said about the exam. Like which topics are relevant and how the exam will look like. It is not only for this lecture but for the whole course. Keep this in mind but don't expect it to be pure facts as it is a messy summary from memory. It is stored at instructions/topic.txt
